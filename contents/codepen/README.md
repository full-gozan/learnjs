# Introduction to CodePen.io
[Learning WebDev](../../README.md) Â» [CodePen.io](./README.md)

In this first section of the roadmap, you will get your hands right on some
programming tasks, and you will also be able to show your work to friends
and relatives.

> Why?  
> **Because you should be freakin' proud of each step you take ðŸ˜Ž**

Throughout this section you will use [CodePen.io][1]. Follow this link, play around,
create an account and learn how this platform works.

The **main benefit** is that you will be able to write code **without worry with
the whole infrastructure and computer setup**.

It's a shortcut that let you dig right into Web Development pulp. No boring
steps, no platform-dependant struggle (they will come later on anyway...)
