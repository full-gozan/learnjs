## ðŸ‘‰ User Story:

```
As a user
Given a list of todo items
When clicking on an item
  Then the item should be removed from the page
```

You can try things out directly on this pen:

## âœ… Proposed Solution:

> Don't run this unless you gave a very good effort to solve it yourself!

{% codepen id = "ZEzqyrY", defaultTab = "js,result" %} {% endcodepen %}

In this second solution we deal with dynamically generated items (basically
an "add" button), it's interesting to note that event handlers must be
explicitly set up for each new item...

{% codepen id = "ExYdXLg", defaultTab = "js,result" %} {% endcodepen %}
