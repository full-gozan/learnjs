# Javascript Â» DOM Â» Todo List

## ðŸ‘‰ User Story:

```
As a user
I should be able to add items to a todo-list
```

You can try things out directly on this pen:  
https://codepen.io/marcopeg/pen/RwbepvX

This is going to be a complex exercise. It is **not difficult**, it just
requires you to pull from the experience that you have accumulated through
all the previous exercises, and combine them to create your first App.

## âœ… Proposed Solution:

> Don't run this unless you gave a very good effort to solve it yourself!

{% codepen id = "RwbeVOp", defaultTab = "js,result" %} {% endcodepen %}
