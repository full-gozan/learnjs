## ðŸ‘‰ User Story:

```
As a developer
Create a new in-memory `P` element
Then append it to the page's `BODY`
```

You can try things out directly on this pen:

## âœ… Proposed Solution:

> Don't run this unless you gave a very good effort to solve it yourself!

{% codepen id = "JjPmRWL", defaultTab = "js,result" %} {% endcodepen %}

In this second solution we are going to use a few different types of node,
in order to generate on the fly a quite complicated web page:

{% codepen id = "dybgNMN", defaultTab = "js,result" %} {% endcodepen %}

In this third solution we are going to play with helper functions, trying
to build a list of custom API (just function names) that will make our
life easier when it comes to building the final page.

{% codepen id = "NWKOdjE", defaultTab = "js,result" %} {% endcodepen %}
