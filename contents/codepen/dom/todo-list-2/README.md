# Javascript Â» DOM Â» Todo List 2

## ðŸ‘‰ User Story:

```
As a user
I should be able to add items to a todo-list
And I should click on an item to remove it
```

You can try things out directly on this pen:

## âœ… Proposed Solution:

> Don't run this unless you gave a very good effort to solve it yourself!

{% codepen id = "pozxwMJ", defaultTab = "js,result" %} {% endcodepen %}

In this second solution we go the extra mile, and implement a common user
experience when it comes to todo list apps.

Clicking on an item merely change a status of "done" or "active". Then
there is a new UI control that, once clicked, cleans up the list from
all the items that are marked as "done".

{% codepen id = "eYOPEpB", defaultTab = "js,result" %} {% endcodepen %}
