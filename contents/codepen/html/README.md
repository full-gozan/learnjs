# HTML

[LearnJS](../../../README.md) Â» [CodePen.io](../README.md)

In this first section, you will move your first steps with _HTML_, the
language of the web.

You will solve all these challenges using [CodePen.io][1], so
**there is no need to setup your computer for now**.

## Read this, if you are a bold one!

If you really want to, just use any text editor (I suggest you
take a look at [VSCode][2] which is easy to use and install) to create
files with `file-name.html` extension

Then you write your solution into it and double click it to
open it with your default browser.
