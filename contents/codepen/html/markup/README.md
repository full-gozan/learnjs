## ðŸ‘‰ User Story:

```
As a user
Given a CodePen url (see below)
I should be able to read a welcoming message on the result panel
And this message should be nicely formatted into titles,
    paragraphs, maybe lists of key points
```

You can try things out directly on this pen:

## âœ… Proposed Solution:

> Don't run this unless you gave a very good effort to solve it yourself!

{% codepen id="rNBJoPx", defaultTab="html,result" %}{% endcodepen %}

## ðŸ¤“ Resources:

This video might be a little old, but they explain things in a simple way.

This video gives you a comprehensive walk around with many different _HTML TAGS_.

**NOTE:** the author uses _Visual Studio Code_ and works on his own computer,
for the sake of simplicity I suggest you **stick with CodePen** for now.

> You will be able to play with all the cool stuff without the need to go
> through the often annoying experience of setting up your machine.
> _We will get to that later on in the roadmap!_

{% youtube embed="PypMN-yui4Y" %}{% endyoutube %}

Here the author goes beyond the _TAGS_ and talk about invisbile items, _HTML entities_
and _meta tags_.
