## ðŸ‘‰ User Story:

```
As a user
Given a CodePen url (see below)
  and an image URL
I should be able to see the image on the result panel
```

Here is the url of a free image that you can use in this exercise:

```

```

You can try things out directly on this pen:

## âœ… Proposed Solution:

> Don't run this unless you gave a very good effort to solve it yourself!

{% codepen id="OJLvLRq", defaultTab="html,result" %}{% endcodepen %}

## ðŸ¤“ Resources:

This video might be a little old, but they explain things in a simple way:

{% youtube embed="G6jZUJcOmgI" %}{% endyoutube %}

This video gives you a comprehensive walk around with many different _HTML TAGS_.
It covers also images about half through the video.

**NOTE:** the author uses _Visual Studio Code_ and works on his own computer,
for the sake of simplicity I suggest you **stick with CodePen** for now.

> _We will get to that later on in the roadmap!_
