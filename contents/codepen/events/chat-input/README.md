## ðŸ‘‰ User Story:

```
As a user
Given a text input element
  And a "post" button
When clicking on the button
  If the input is empty
    Then alert an error message
  Else
    Alert the input text
    Then clear the input element
    And keep focus on the input element
```

This is not an easy exercise and it will probably give you a decent challenge.  
**But you can do it**, and in the end you will have build a fundamental UI component!
