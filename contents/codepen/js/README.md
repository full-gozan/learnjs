It's time to make things fun ðŸ˜Ž

So far you dealt with **static markup and declarative code**: _HTML_ and _CSS_.

> They are similar in the way that you explain what you want, and then hand over to the
> browser the task of actually implementing your will.

**And once you write the code, things won't change.**

Ok, with _CSS_ you learned about [pseudoclasses][1] that can be used to make some UI effects.
Still the animations that you put in place are always the same!

## Welcome Javascript

With _Javascript_ you are finally dealing with a [real programming language][2]!

With _Javascript_ you can:

- take decisions
- remember informations
- automate repeating tasks

> With _Javascript_ you make a Web Page behave the way you want!  
> It's the first step into making a modern WebApp.

## Setup your CodePen correctly

From now on, it may take you a while to write the correct code that you actually want to
execute, and the "auto run" feature that we used so far in our CodePens may cause you pain.

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you go through this tutorial and learn how to disable it:
