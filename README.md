# Learning WebDev

This is a roadmap of **progressively interesting exercises** that guide you
through the unique experience of becoming a Web Developer.

> My personal suggestion is that you start from the basics and move forward
> at your own peace.  
> **You set your own level of efforts.**

### ðŸ‘‰ Progress by User Stories

**Each exercise comes with a [user story][1]** that speaks a language that you
will find in your daily routine at the office.

Make an effort to deeply consider all the parts of the user story, try to
understand it and put yourself in the shoes of the virtual client.

> A good part of the developer's job is to understand requirements!

### ðŸ¤“ Learn with the External Resources

You will also find a list of external resources that may help you getting
through the exercise.

Internet is full of tutorials, guides and videos. We are working hard to
curate an index of relevant resources for every lesson.

**And you are welcome to contribute:** whenever you have new ideas for improving 
the list of resources, feel free to create a new [Pull Request][2], 
or [file an issue][3] in [our repo][4]!

### âœ… Check out the Proposed Solution

Most of the exercises will also **include a proposed solution** that may be an
embedded runnable (stuff that you can play with right from your browser), or
a link to external GitHub repos or articles.

I suggest you put your best effort in **solving the exercise by yourself** before
you look into that solution! It's even better if you **team up** with one or two
friends and move through this roadmap together.

### ðŸ’¬ Comment and Engage

Each page of this website hosts a **live message board**.

Join in when you have ideas to share or questions that can't be answered by
Google or Stackoverflow (always look there first!).

A nice way to use the message board is to share the solutions to problems you
have solved with Internet. Or just share your exercises by linking your
repos or your online IDE pages.

### ðŸ™Œ Collaborate

Did you know that all the sources for this website are [publicly available on GitHub?][4]

If you find any typos, errors, outdated resources; or if you have propositions for
a new lesson, more resources and better examples...

Then please take the time to [**fork our repo** and **submit a Pull Request**][2]!
