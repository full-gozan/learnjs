# LearnJS  » Contribute

Ahoy, welcome aboard!

LearnJS is an OpenSource initiative.

The whole source code is 
[available in our GitHub repo][1] and **we need your help to make LearnJS
a useful learning tool**.

## What can I do?

Here is a brief list of how you can impact the learning curve of
your fellow students:

- fix typos
- improve existing contents
- remove outdated resources from the exercise pages
- add relevant resources to the exercise pages
- create new exercise pages

## How can I do it?

There are mostly 3 possible ways to contribute:

- clone the repo and submit pull requests (see below)
- [submit new issues in the repo board][2]
- comment your ideas in the exercise page

## What the heck is a Pull Request anyway?

I'm glad you asked! 

1️⃣ A _Pull Request_ is a standard contribution practice in modern 
software development, you can make changes to the project's code base 
and you can submit them for approval.

2️⃣ The approval process is usually community driven.

The collaborators in the project can use a message board to review, 
discuss and maybe ask for some changes.

3️⃣ When everyone is satisfied, the change will be accepted and published.

> The cool thing is that **your contribution will be listed in the 
> project's history** and you can use it during interviews to 
> **prove your skills and good will with a potential employer 🤠**.

### Resources

- [This seems to me a very simple beginner guide to OS contributions][3]
- [Alternative guide that takes branching into account][4]

### The Golden Rule of Pull Requests

- few
- focused
- changes

A good scope would be a single exercise page.  
Pick one and do your best in order to improve it.  
Then submit it.

**If you want to fix more stuff, use branches and create multiple PRs 🤠.**
